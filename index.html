    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>Problem Statement: Shoppers are buying a lot of different food items and are not sure what the nutritional values of the items they bought are. This app will keep track of that information and show the user the total nutritional value of their shopping list.<br>
      Who is experiencing the problem?: People that cook at home and are trying to keep watch of their daily nutrients.<br>
      What is the problem?: Many people buy groceries without knowing the nutritional value of the items they are buying and could be eating an unhealthy diet because of so.<br>
      Where does the problem present itself?: The problem comes from most people not taking the time to individually check all their groceries nutritional facts when buying groceries.<br>
      Why does it matter?: Nutritional balance is very important when it comes to overall body health and if people could easily see the nutritional values of their groceries then they may develop better eating habits.
